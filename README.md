# Finding's Relevance
This finding is relevant because it gives us confidence that some people who originally would vote for Repulican switched party to vote for Democrats

# Replicate Findings
The code is running on Python 3.9.12. To install necessary packages, run the following in terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Since the data is larger than 300mb, I zipped it. Once you clone the repository and unzip the data, change the path location in the Jupiter Notebook to replicate the findings
